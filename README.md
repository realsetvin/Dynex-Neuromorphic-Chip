# Dynex-Neuromorphic-Chip

Reference implementations of the Dynex Neuromorphic Chip as described [on our website](https://dynexcoin.org/dynex-neuromorphic-chip/).

## C++ Reference Implementation (CPU)

File "dynex.cc" is a reference implementation of the neuromorphic circuit. It integrates the system of equations (ODE) derived from the circuit model on a CPU. The reference design solves the Boolean satisfiability problem (sometimes called propositional satisfiability problem and abbreviated SATISFIABILITY, SAT or B-SAT). A propositional logic formula, also called Boolean expression, is built from variables, operators AND (conjunction, also denoted by ∧), OR (disjunction, ∨), NOT (negation, ¬), and parentheses. 

A formula is said to be satisfiable if it can be made TRUE by assigning appropriate logical values (i.e. TRUE, FALSE) to its variables. The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is, given a formula, to check whether it is satisfiable. This decision problem is of central importance in many areas of computer science, including theoretical computer science, complexity theory, algorithmics, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. Please note that this reference implementation proves the mathematical model and is not as efficient as the implementation by commercial miners. 

To illustrate the performance of neuromorphic computing, the following example showcases an implementation of a constraint satisfaction problem, where a problem formulation with complexity O(n^100,000) is being solved using the Dynex Neuromorphic Chip. The problem consists of 100,000 unique variables. Existing methodologies based on current and Quantum technology (reducing the complexity with Shor’s algorithm to O(n^50,000) cannot solve this problem class efficiently today. The Dynex Neuromorphic Chip solves the problem in a few seconds because of its inherent parallelization, its long-range order, and its capability to utilize instantons.

This reference implementation proves the mathematical model and has not been optimized for speed and performance.

PalSat is a very efficient parallel implementation and has been designed to achieve high computational speed. It requires PalSat 16-28 million flips (=computing operations) for finding solutions. 

*In comparison, the Dynex reference implementation, which has not been optimized for speed but to showcase the calculations in a clear and understandable way in the source code, requires only between 15 - 183 integration steps to find a solution. TTS for Dynex is greatly improved in the DNX mining software implementations.

### Notes and Remarks

- The Dynex Chip is not a physically produced chip, DynexSolve simulates them by integrating its equations of motion (ODE integration)
Extrapolating the equations of motions from the chip design requires a number of variables/parameters to be introduced (as explained in the DynexSolve paper)

- In the case of SAT problems, there are in total 6 parameters to be defined. These parameters depend on the underlying structure of a problem type. The reference implementation used in our example is applying tuned parameters for the problem type stemming from Barthel instances and may not be suitable / applicable out of the box for other problem types

- Identifying the optimal parameters is an iterative tuning process that happens on the Dynex platform where a large number of GPUs are tuning in until they have identified the best values

- With parameters tuned, TTS is optimized and applicable for every similar problem type, meaning problems of similar type can be solved even more efficiently on the platform.

## CUDA Reference Implementation (GPU)

File "dynex.cu" is a reference implementation of the neuromorphic circuit. It integrates the system of equations (ODE) derived from the circuit model on a GPU. The reference design solves the Boolean satisfiability problem (sometimes called propositional satisfiability problem and abbreviated SATISFIABILITY, SAT or B-SAT). A propositional logic formula, also called Boolean expression, is built from variables, operators AND (conjunction, also denoted by ∧), OR (disjunction, ∨), NOT (negation, ¬), and parentheses. A formula is said to be satisfiable if it can be made TRUE by assigning appropriate logical values (i.e. TRUE, FALSE) to its variables. The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is, given a formula, to check whether it is satisfiable. This decision problem is of central importance in many areas of computer science, including theoretical computer science, complexity theory, algorithmics, cryptography and artificial intelligence. Please note that this reference implementation proves the mathematical model.
